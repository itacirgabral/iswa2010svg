## 3 Dynamics &Timing
Dynamics Symbols are used mostly with Movement  Symbols  and  Punctuation Symbols, to give the "feeling" or "tempo" to  movement.  They  also  provide  em-phasis  on  a  movement  or  expression, and  combined  with  Puncuation  Sym-bols become the equivalent to Exclama-tion  Points.  The  Tension  Symbol,  com-bined  with  Contact  Symbols,  provides the feeling of "pressure", and combined with  facial  expressions  can  place  em-phasis  or  added  feeling  to  an  expres-sion. Timing symbols are used to show alternating  or  simultaneous  movement.

## 4 Head & Face
Group 2 includes head movement and positions of the head.Starting from the top of the face and moving down, Groups 23-26 include detailed facial expressions and movement of parts of the face and neck.
1. Head
2. Brow Eyes Eyegaze
3. Cheeks Ears Nose Breath
4. Mouth Lips
5. Tongue Teeth Chin Neck

## 5 Body
Torso  movement,  shoulders,  hips,  and the limbs are used in Sign Languages as a part of grammar, especially when de-scribing  conversations  between  people,  called  Role  Shifting,  or  making  spatial comparisons  between  items  on  the  left  and items on the right. The symbols of the body that are in Category 5 are im-portant  when  writing  sign  language  sto-rytelling  and  poetry.  All  sign  languages have  some  signs  that  point  below  the  hips,  or  touch  the  torso,  or  hunch  the  shoulders, or touch the arms and wrists.

## 6 Detailed Location
The  symbols  in  Category  6  are  de-tailed  Location  Markers  that  are  not used when writing signs on a daily ba-sis.  Location  is  written  and  read  in SignWriting WITHOUT   these   symbols.

The symbols in Category 6 are only used in  computer  software  to  assist  in  giv-ing  further  details  for  sorting  large  sign language  dictionaries  that  are  sorted by    SignWriting    symbols.    Sometimes    signs  that  are  slightly  different,  may have  similar  SignSpelling  data,  and  the symbols in Category 6 can help decide which sign should come first and which should  come  second,  in  the  dictionary.

## 7 Punctuation
Punctuation Symbols are used when writ-ing complete sentences or documents in SignWriting. The Punctuation Symbols do not  look  like  the  symbols  for  punctuation  in English, but they do have similar mean-ings.   SignWriting   punctuation   symbols   include  a  period,  comma,  colon,  semi-colon,  exclamation  point  and  so  forth.
